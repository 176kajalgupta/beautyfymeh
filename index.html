    This will proof a great start for your wonderful day. Don't <br> miss few yoga asana's and

    <span style ="background-color: rgba(127, 255, 212, 0.526) "> Starting with your skin</span>
    For beginners,
     we recommend starting with a basic three step routine—cleanse, 
    moisturize, and apply<br> sunscreen. Of course, this can be modified, 
    and products can be added depending on your individual skincare needs.<br>
    One of the first steps on the road to building a skincare routine is 
    determining your skin type. Different skin types have varying <br>needs that 
    need to
     be met by skincare products. Oily skin types may be more concerned with
      mattifying ingredients, as opposed<br> to dry skin types that need thick
       and rich 
      moisturizers.

    One easy way to determine your skin type is to observe your skin <br>throughout
     the day. Is your skin shiny and oily by lunchtime, or dry and flakey
      in the morning? Whatever the case, these<br> characteristics are indicative 
      of your skin type.<br>
    </p>
    <p><span style ="background-color: rgba(9, 197, 134, 0.526) ">As dermatologists,</span><br><br><br>
      <b> we classify skin into four main types:</b><br><br>
    
    <b> Oily skin:</b> Skin that looks shiny due to an overproduction of oil.<br>
    <b>Dry skin:</b> Skin with dry and flakey areas that may feel tight.<br>
    <b>skin:</b> Skin with red and irritated areas that are typically
     painful to the touch.<br>
    <b>skin:</b> Skin that has a combination of oily and flakey areas.<br>
